# APRSdroid TelemetrySender

This app uses on-screen buttons to launch the APRSdroid service and to
send APRS telemetry packets via `SEND_PACKET`. It also sends telemetry
data obtained from the local Android sensors on a configurable interval.

All available sensors get displayed on the main screen. It is possible
to configure which 5 sensors should be send over APRS telemetry packets.

Please see [APRSdroid](http://aprsdroid.org/) for the master application.

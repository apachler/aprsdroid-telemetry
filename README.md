# APRSdroid API Example

This is a minimal example project to demonstrate the use of APRSdroid's
`SEND_PACKET` API, introduced in version 1.2.4.

This app uses on-screen buttons to launch the APRSdroid service, and to
send APRS packets via `SEND_PACKET`. The packets contain telemetry data
obtained from the local Android sensors:

 * Light sensor
 * Pressure
 * Temperature
 * Proximity

Please see [APRSdroid](http://aprsdroid.org/) for the master application.
